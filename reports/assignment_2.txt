1.What are 2 things that you learned from this assignment?
    In this assignment, we learnt about methods used in xinu like message passing to synchronize the processes
    We also learnt to use polling function in this assignment and gained deeper insights in xinu.
    
2.What are 2 mistakes that you made in this assignment, and how did you discover and fix these mistakes?
    While creating another process, I used priority no. as 30 in the create function, it created some anomalies in xinu for me. 
    I later changed it according to 20 to avoid those anomalies.
    In polling, my processes were running without infinitely initially as I wasn't handling exit condition. 
    
3.If you were restarting this assignment, what would you change about how you went about completing this assignment?
    I should have done message passing first, as I could learn exactly how the message passing between two processes work, so that would have also assisted me in polling.
    So, I would have used multiple rounds directly in polling rather than polling for single first and then changing it for multiple rounds.
